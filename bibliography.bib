	abstract = {We define a new class of symplectic objects called "stops", which roughly speaking are Liouville hypersurfaces in the boundary of a Liouville domain. Locally, these can be viewed as pages of a compatible open book. To a Liouville domain with a collection of disjoint stops, we assign an \$A\_{\textbackslash}infty\$-category called its partially wrapped Fukaya category. An exact Landau-Ginzburg model gives rise to a stop, and the corresponding partially wrapped Fukaya category is meant to agree with the Fukaya category one is supposed to assign to the Landau-Ginzburg model. As evidence, we prove a formula that relates these partially wrapped Fukaya categories to the wrapped Fukaya category of the underlying Liouville domain. This operation is mirror to removing a divisor. In v2, we also construct continuation functors without cascades, which should be of independent interest.},

	abstract = {We study the derived categories of coherent sheaves of weighted projective spaces and their noncommutative deformations, and the derived categories of Lagrangian vanishing cycles of their mirror Landau-Ginzburg models. In particular, we show that the derived category of coherent sheaves (B-branes) on the weighted projective plane \${\textbackslash}CP{\textasciicircum}2(a,b,c)\$ is equivalent to the derived category of vanishing cycles (A-branes) on the affine hypersurface \$X={\textbackslash}\{x{\textasciicircum}ay{\textasciicircum}bz{\textasciicircum}c=1{\textbackslash}\}{\textbackslash}subset ({\textbackslash}C{\textasciicircum}*){\textasciicircum}3\$ equipped with an exact symplectic form and the superpotential \$W=x+y+z\$. Hence, the homological mirror symmetry conjecture holds for weighted projective planes. Moreover, we also show that this mirror correspondence between derived categories can be extended to toric noncommutative deformations of \${\textbackslash}CP{\textasciicircum}2(a,b,c)\$ where B-branes are concerned, and their mirror counterparts, non-exact deformations of the symplectic structure of \$X\$ where A-branes are concerned. We also obtain similar results for other examples such as weighted projective lines or Hirzebruch surfaces.},

	abstract = {Motivated by homological mirror symmetry, this paper constructs explicit full exceptional collections for the canonical stacks associated with the series of log del Pezzo surfaces constructed by Johnson and Kollár. These surfaces have cyclic quotient, non-Gorenstein, singularities. The construction involves both the \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{GL\}(2,{\textbackslash}mathbb\{C\})\$ McKay correspondence, and the study of the minimal resolutions of the surfaces, which are birational to degree two del Pezzo surfaces. We show that a degree two del Pezzo surface arises in this way if and only if it admits a generalized Eckardt point, and in the course of the paper we classify the blow-ups of \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{P\}{\textasciicircum}2\$ giving rise to them. Our result on the adjoints of the functor of Ishii-Ueda applies to any finite small subgroup of \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{GL\}(2,{\textbackslash}mathbb\{C\})\$.},

	abstract = {We develop a set of tools for doing computations in and of (partially) wrapped Fukaya categories. In particular, we prove (1) a descent (cosheaf) property for the wrapped Fukaya category with respect to so-called Weinstein sectorial coverings and (2) that the partially wrapped Fukaya category of a Weinstein manifold with respect to a mostly Legendrian stop is generated by the cocores of the critical handles and the linking disks to the stop. We also prove (3) a `stop removal equals localization' result, and (4) that the Fukaya--Seidel category of a Lefschetz fibration with Liouville fiber is generated by the Lefschetz thimbles. These results are derived from three main ingredients, also of independent use: (5) a Künneth formula (6) an exact triangle in the Fukaya category associated to wrapping a Lagrangian through a Legendrian stop at infinity and (7) a geometric criterion for when a pushforward functor between wrapped Fukaya categories of Liouville sectors is fully faithful.},
